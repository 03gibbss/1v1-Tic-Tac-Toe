- Add game state to object 'preparing' / 'ready' / 'finished' / 'player disconnected'
- Destroy the game after x time if finished or player disconnected

- Game board doesn't currently get enabled properly if you rejoin a game - need to fix up some of the logic here


- Maybe just get rid of reconnecting - maybe that is beyond the scale of this - just get rid of the game if a player disconnects
